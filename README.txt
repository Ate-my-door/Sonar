Another sunken treasure... erm... just a joking! 
Another great text mode game from the book 
"Invent your own computer games with Python" by 
Al Sweigart. Now it's rewritten for the C++ 
programming language for the all people around 
the world so that everyone could run this little 
console game on any computer even without an 
installed Python interpreter and to become a 
little happier !!! 

And please read the instructions included with 
the game very carefully !!!
